# Contribution guideline for data fetchers

- Data fetchers are responsible for:
  - loading all available data from a given source (providing a ``.to_xarray()`` method)
  - making data compliant to Argo standards (data type, variable name, attributes, etc ...)
  - providing the end-user API (``argopy.fetchers.ArgoDataFetcher``) methods to filter data
    according to user level or requests. These must includes:
      1. ``.filter_data_mode``
      1. ``.filter_qc``
      1. ``.filter_variables``

It is the responsability of the higher level end-user API (``argopy.fetchers.ArgoDataFetcher``) to run filters according to user level or requests
