1. On the master branch, commit the release in git:

      ```git commit -a -m 'Release v0.X.Y'```
1. Tag the release:

      ```git tag -a v0.X.Y -m 'v0.X.Y'```

1. Issue the release on GitHub. Click on "Draft a new release" at
    https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/releases. Type in the version number, but
    don't bother to describe it -- we maintain that on the docs instead.
