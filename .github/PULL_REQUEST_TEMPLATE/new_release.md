# Publish release

- [ ] On the master branch, commit the release in git:
      ```git commit -a -m 'Release v0.X.Y'```
- [ ] Tag the release:
      ```git tag -a v0.X.Y -m 'v0.X.Y'```
- [ ] Push it online:
       ```git push origin v0.X.Y```
- [ ] Issue the release on GitHub. Click on "Draft a new release" at
     https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/releases. Type in the version number, but
     don't bother to describe it -- we maintain that on the docs instead.
      
     This will trigger the [publish Github action](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/blob/master/.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml) that will push the release on Pypi.
